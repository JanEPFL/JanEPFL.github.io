# Abstract
After in 2015 all 20 oscar acting nominations were awared to white people, the #OscarsSoWhite hastag, criticising the lack of diveristy in the film industry, went viral. But should the film industry comply with these demands purely for ethical reasons, or do capitalistically motivated actors in the film industry also benefit from a more diverse cast? To investigate whether a more diverse cast attracts a larger audience and thus achieves more financial success, we examine the box office revenue of the films in the ["CMU Movie Summary Corpus"](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) dataset. As a measure of diversity, we focus on ethnicity, gender, and age. In particular, we are interested in whether moviegoers' preference or rejection for movies with a more diverse cast has changed over the last 100 years.
