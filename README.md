## They won an academy award in 2015 and they are all white.

# So what is this about?
After in 2015 all 20 oscar acting nominations were awarded to white people, the #OscarsSoWhite hastag, criticising the lack of diveristy in the film industry, went viral. But should the film industry comply with these demands purely for ethical reasons, or does the film industry benefit from a more diverse cast also from a capitalistical standpoint? To investigate whether a more diverse cast attracts a larger audience and thus achieves more financial success, we examine the box office revenue of the films in the ["CMU Movie Summary Corpus"](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) dataset. As a measure of diversity, we focus mainly on ethnicity, gender, and age. In particular, we are interested in whether moviegoers' acceptance or rejection for movies with a more diverse cast has changed over the last 100 years. Since movies produced in the US have the biggest audience and make by far the most money, we'll restrict our analysis on these movies.

# And why should we care?
## 1) Financial reasons
The movie business is a multi-billion-dollar industry, therefore it would be very beneficial to know what sells and what does not. 

## 2) Societal relevance
Diversity is one of the most controversial topics of our time. However the discussions about this are mostly based on subjective feelings and impressions. An analysis based on data should lead to a more objective assessment of this contentious subject. And since movies can be seen as a reflection of their time, the results of our analysis could act as an indicator for changes and advancements in society over time.

# So what is diversity

# This leads us to our research questions

##	Which characteristics of movies are correlated with the movie box office revenue?
TODO: Insert box office revenue vs other features plot (as a logarithmic plot)
As we can see in the plot above, the box office revenue correlates with the budget of the movie. A higher budget tends to lead to a higher gross. We can also see that the public perception of a movie which is getting represented through the TMDB vote counts and vote averages slightly correlates with the box office. This implies that a movie which is getting perceived as a good movie is making more money than a movie which is getting perceived as a bad movie. The runtime on the other hand does not seem to have an influence on the financial success of a movie.

TODO: Insert box office revenue vs m ratio and f ratio plots
TODO: Elaborate on the implications of these plots
