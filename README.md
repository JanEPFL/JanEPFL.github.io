# So what is this about?
After in 2015 all 20 oscar acting nominations were awarded to white people, the #OscarsSoWhite hastag, criticising the lack of diveristy in the film industry, went viral. But should the film industry comply with these demands purely for ethical reasons, or do capitalistically motivated actors in the film industry also benefit from a more diverse cast? To investigate whether a more diverse cast attracts a larger audience and thus achieves more financial success, we examine the box office revenue of the films in the ["CMU Movie Summary Corpus"](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) dataset. As a measure of diversity, we focus on ethnicity, gender, and age. In particular, we are interested in whether moviegoers' preference or rejection for movies with a more diverse cast has changed over the last 100 years. Since movies produced in the US make by far the most money, we'll restrict our analysis on these movies.

# And why should we care?

1) Ethical reasons:
Diversity is really important! And since movies can be seen as a reflection of their time, the results of this analysis could act as an indicator for changes and advancements in society over time.

2) Financial reasons:
Since the movie business is a multi-billion-dollar industry, it would be very beneficial to know what sells and what does not. 

# This leads us to our research questions:

##	Which characteristics of movies are correlated with a high movie box office revenue?
TODO: Insert box office revenue vs other features plot (as a logaritmic plot)
As we can see in the plot above, the box office revenue correlates with the budget of the movie. A higher budget tends to lead to a higher gross. We can also see that the public perception of a movie which is getting represented through the TMDB vote counts and vote averages slightly correlates with the box office. This implies that a movie which is getting perceived as a good movie is making more money than a movie which is getting perceived as a bad movie. The runtime on the other hand does not seem to have an influence on the financial success of a movie.

TODO: Elaborate on the implications of these plots
